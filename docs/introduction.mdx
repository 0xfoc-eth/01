The 01 Operating System (01OS) is open source software that operates computers using language models, powered by Open Interpreter.
This allows computers to understand natural language requests, and execute tasks on your behalf.
These guides will cover the steps for installing, using, and teaching 01OS.

## Getting Started

The 01 Light is the interface with 01OS. It connects to your computer or our hosted service via the Internet or directly to an 01 Heavy (coming soon).

You can order a pre-made device or find instructions for building your own at openinterpreter.com/01OS/guides/hardware-guide.
You will always have the option to build your own device.

To connect to your device, use the one click installer.

_Disclaimer:_ The current version of 01OS is a developer preview.
