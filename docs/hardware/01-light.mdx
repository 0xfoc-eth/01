The Bill of Materials for the 01 Light can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01/blob/main/hardware/light/BOM.md).

# Chip (ESP32)

To setup the ESP32 to work with 01, follow this guide to install the firmware:

To set up audio recording + playback on the ESP32 (M5 Atom), do the following:

1. Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Get the firmware by copying the contents of [client.ino](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01/blob/main/software/source/clients/esp32/src/client/client.ino) from the 01 repository.
3. Open Arduino IDE and paste the client.ino contents
4. Go to Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager, search "esp32", then install the boards by Arduino and Espressif
5. Go to Tools -> Manage Libraries, then install the following:

- M5Atom by M5Stack [Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/m5atom/)
- WebSockets by Markus Sattler [Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/websockets/)

6. The board needs to connect to WiFi. Once you flash, connect to ESP32 wifi "captive" which will get wifi details. Once it connects, it will ask you to enter 01OS server address in the format "domain.com:port" or "ip:port". Once its able to connect you can use the device.
7. To flash the .ino to the board, connect the board to the USB port, select the port from the dropdown on the IDE, then select the M5Atom board (or M5Stack-ATOM if you have that). Click on upload to flash the board.

# Case

This case of the 01 can be 3d printed at home. It is recommended to use a resin printer for improved quality.

# Connect

### Captive portal

To connect your 01, you will use the captive portal.

1. Turn on your computer or laptop and connect to the '01 light' Wi-Fi network.
2. Enter your Wi-Fi/hotspot name and password in the captive portal page.
3. Enter the server URL generated on their computer and hit 'Connect'.

Now you're connected and ready to go!
