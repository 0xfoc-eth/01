You can build your own custom hardware that uses the 01 server.

To use 01 with your custom hardware, run the server:

```bash
poetry run 01 --server
```

You may need to set additional parameters via [flags](/software/flags) depending on your setup.

To transmit audio commands to 01, send LMC audio chunks to the websocket defined by your server.
