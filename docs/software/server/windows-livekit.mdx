LiveKit Installation and Usage Guide for Windows

Prerequisites

Required Software:
- IDE (e.g., VSCode, Cursor)
- Git
- Python (version 3.11.9 recommended)
- Poetry (Python package manager)
- LiveKit server for Windows
- FFmpeg

Python Installation:
1. Install Python 3.11.9 (latest version [less than] 3.12) using the binary installer.

Poetry Installation:
Poetry installation on Windows can be challenging. If you encounter SSL certificate verification issues, try the following workaround:

1. Download the installation script from https://install.python-poetry.org/ and save it as install-poetry.py.
2. Modify the get(self, url): method in the script to disable certificate verification:

def get(self, url):
    import ssl
    import certifi
    request = Request(url)
    context = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())
    context.check_hostname = False
    context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
    with closing(urlopen(request, context=context)) as r:
        return r.read()

3. Run the modified script to install Poetry.
4. Add Poetry's bin directory to your PATH:
   - Path: C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts
   - Follow the guide at: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html

LiveKit Server Installation:
1. Download the latest release of LiveKit server for Windows (e.g., livekit_1.7.2_windows_amd64.zip).
2. Extract the livekit-server.exe file to your /software directory.

FFmpeg Installation:
1. Download the FFmpeg Windows build from: https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
   - Choose the ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip (non-shared suffix) version.
2. Extract the compressed zip and add the FFmpeg bin directory to your PATH.

Installation Steps:

1. Run 'poetry install'. If you encounter an error about Microsoft Visual C++, install "Microsoft C++ Build Tools":
   - Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - In the installation popup, select "Desktop Development with C++" with preselected components.

2. Set up your Anthropic API key:
   setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY [your_api_key]

3. Modify main.py to correctly locate and run the LiveKit server:
   - Set the LiveKit path:
     livekit_path = "path/to/your/01/software/livekit-server"
   - Modify the server command for Windows:
     f"{livekit_path} --dev --bind {server_host} --port {server_port}"
   Note: Remove the '> /dev/null 2>&1' section from the command as it's not compatible with Windows.

Troubleshooting:

- If you encounter "ffmpeg not found" errors or issues when sending messages, ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and added to your PATH.
- For any SSL certificate issues during installation, refer to the Poetry installation workaround provided above.

Additional Notes:

- This guide assumes you're using Windows. Some commands or paths may need to be adjusted for your specific setup.
- Always ensure you're using the latest versions of software and check official documentation for any recent changes.
