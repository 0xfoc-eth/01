## Livekit vs. Light Server

- **Livekit Server**: Designed for devices with higher processing power, such as phones, web browsers, and more capable hardware. It offers a full range of features and robust performance.

- **Light Server**: We have another lightweight server called the Light server, specifically designed for ESP32 devices. It's optimized for low-power, constrained environments.
