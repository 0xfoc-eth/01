This server leverages the Livekit SDK and is used for the mobile apps.

It uses WebRTC for real-time communication and is very robust.

To run the Livekit server:

```bash
poetry run 01 --server livekit
```

<Note>
  Speech to Text and Text to Speech are handled by Livekit plugins which
  requires a Deepgram or ElevenLabs API key.
</Note>

Set env var API keys.
