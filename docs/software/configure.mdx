A core part of the 01 server is the interpreter which is an instance of Open Interpreter.
Open Interpreter is highly configurable and only requires updating or creating a profile.
Properties such as `model`, `context_window`, and many more can be updated here.

To open the directory of all profiles, run:

```bash
# View profiles
poetry run 01 --profiles
```

To apply a profile to your 01 instance, use the `--profile` flag followed by the name of the profile

```bash
# Use profile
poetry run 01 --profile <profile_name>
```

### Standard Profiles

`default.py` is the default profile that is used when no profile is specified. The default TTS is OpenAI.

`fast.py` uses elevenlabs and groq, which are the fastest providers.

`local.py` uses coqui TTS and runs the --local explorer from Open Interpreter.

### Custom Profiles

If you want to make your own file, you can do so by creating a new file in the `profiles` directory.
The easiest way is to duplicate an existing profile and then update values as needed. Be sure to save the profile with a unique name.

```bash
# Use custom profile
poetry run 01 --profile <profile_name>
```
