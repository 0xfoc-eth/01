A core part of the 01 server is the interpreter which is an instance of Open Interpreter.
Open Interpreter is highly configurable and only requires updating or creating a profile.
Properties such as `model`, `context_window`, and many more can be updated here.

To open the directory of all profiles, run:

```bash
# View profiles
poetry run 01 --profiles
```

To apply a profile to your 01 instance, use the `--profile` flag followed by the name of the profile

```bash
# Use profile
poetry run 01 --profile <profile_name>
```

### Standard Profiles

`default.py` is the default profile that is used when no profile is specified. The default TTS is OpenAI.

`fast.py` uses elevenlabs and groq, which are the fastest providers.

`local.py` uses coqui TTS and runs the --local explorer from Open Interpreter.

### Custom Profiles

If you want to make your own file, you can do so by creating a new file in the `profiles` directory.
The easiest way is to duplicate an existing profile and then update values as needed. Be sure to save the profile with a unique name.

```bash
# Use custom profile
poetry run 01 --profile <profile_name>
```

### Hosted LLMs

The default LLM for 01 is GPT-4-Turbo. You can find this in the default profile in `software/source/server/profiles/default.py`.

The fast profile uses Llama3-8b served by Groq. You can find this in the fast profile in `software/source/server/profiles/fast.py`.

```python
# Set your profile with a hosted LLM
interpreter.llm.model = "gpt-4o"
```

### Local LLMs

You can use local models to power 01.

Using the local profile launches the Local Explorer where you can select your inference provider and model. The default options include Llamafile, Jan, Ollama, and LM Studio.

```python
# Set your profile with a local LLM
interpreter.local_setup()
```

### Hosted TTS

01 supports OpenAI and Elevenlabs for hosted TTS

```python
# Set your profile with a hosted TTS service
interpreter.tts = "elevenlabs"
```

### Local TTS

For local TTS, Coqui is used.

```python
# Set your profile with a local TTS service
interpreter.tts = "coqui"
```
