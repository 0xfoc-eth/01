A core part of the 01 server is the interpreter which is an instance of Open Interpreter.
Open Interpreter is highly configurable and only requires updating a profile.

```bash
# View profiles
poetry run 01 --profiles
```

Properties such as `model`, `context_window`, and many more can be updated here.

To assign a profile to your 01 instance, use the `--profile` flag:

```bash
# Use profile
poetry run 01 --profile <profile_name>
```
