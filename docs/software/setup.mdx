## Run Server

```bash
poetry run 01  --server
```

## Configure

A core part of the 01 server is the interpreter which is an instance of Open Interpreter.
Open Interpreter is highly configurable and only requires updating a single file.

```bash
# Edit i.py
software/source/server/i.py
```

Properties such as `model`, `context_window`, and many more can be updated here.

### LLM service provider

If you wish to use a local model, you can use the `--llm-service` flag:

```bash
# use llamafile
poetry run 01 --server --llm-service llamafile
```

For more information about LLM service providers, check out the page on <a href="/services/language-model">Language Models</a>.

### Voice Interface

Both speech-to-text and text-to-speech can be configured in 01OS.

You are able to pass CLI flags `--tts-service` and/or `--stt-service` with the desired service provider to swap out different services

These different service providers can be found in `/services/stt` and `/services/tts`
