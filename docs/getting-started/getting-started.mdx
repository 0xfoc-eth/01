## What is Poetry?

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. We use Poetry to ensure that everyone running 01 has the same environment and dependencies.

### MacOS

On MacOS, we use Homebrew (a package manager) to install the required dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew install portaudio ffmpeg cmake
```

This command installs:

- PortAudio: A cross-platform audio I/O library
- FFmpeg: A complete, cross-platform solution for recording, converting, and streaming audio and video
- CMake: An open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software

### Ubuntu

<Note>Wayland not supported, only Ubuntu 20.04 and below</Note>

```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev ffmpeg cmake
```

This command installs:

- PortAudio: A cross-platform audio I/O library
- FFmpeg: A complete solution for recording, converting, and streaming audio and video
- CMake: An open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software

### Windows

- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual) to install the required packages.
- [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools):
  - Choose [**Download Build Tools**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
  - Run the downloaded file **vs_BuildTools.exe**.
  - In the installer, select **Workloads** > **Desktop & Mobile** > **Desktop Development with C++**.

With these installed, you can run the following commands in a **PowerShell terminal as an administrator**:

```powershell
# Install the required packages
choco install -y ffmpeg
```
