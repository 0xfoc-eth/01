## Prerequisites

To run the 01 on your computer, you will need to install the following essential packages:

- Git
- Python (version 3.11.x recommended)
- Poetry
- FFmpeg

## Installation Guide

### For All Platforms

1. **Git**: Download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Python**: 
   - Download Python 3.11.x from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH".

3. **Poetry**: 
   - Follow the [official Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).
   - If you encounter SSL certificate issues on Windows, see the Windows-specific instructions below.

4. **FFmpeg**: Installation instructions vary by platform (see below).

### Platform-Specific Instructions

#### MacOS

We recommend using Homebrew to install the required dependencies:

```bash
brew install portaudio ffmpeg cmake
```

#### Ubuntu

**Note**: Wayland is not supported. These instructions are for Ubuntu 20.04 and below.

Install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev ffmpeg cmake
```

#### Windows

1. **Git**: Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

2. **Python**: 
   - Download Python 3.11.x from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
   - During installation, ensure you check "Add Python to PATH".

3. **Microsoft C++ Build Tools**:
   - Download from [Microsoft's website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
   - Run the installer and select "Desktop development with C++" from the Workloads tab.
   - This step is crucial for Poetry to work correctly.

4. **Poetry**:
   - If the standard installation method fails due to SSL issues, try this workaround:
     1. Download the installation script from [https://install.python-poetry.org/](https://install.python-poetry.org/) and save it as `install-poetry.py`.
     2. Open the file and replace the `get(self, url):` method with:
        ```python
        def get(self, url):
            import ssl
            import certifi
            request = Request(url, headers={"User-Agent": "Python Poetry"})
            context = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())
            context.check_hostname = False
            context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
            with closing(urlopen(request, context=context)) as r:
                return r.read()
        ```
     3. Run the modified script to install Poetry.
   - Add Poetry to your PATH:
     1. Press Win + R, type "sysdm.cpl", and press Enter.
     2. Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables".
     3. Under "User variables", find "Path" and click "Edit".
     4. Click "New" and add: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts`
     5. Click "OK" to close all windows.

5. **FFmpeg**:
   - Download the latest FFmpeg build from the [BtbN GitHub releases page](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases).
   - Choose the `ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip` (non-shared suffix) file.
   - Extract the compressed zip file.
   - Add the FFmpeg `bin` folder to your PATH:
     1. Press Win + R, type "sysdm.cpl", and press Enter.
     2. Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables".
     3. Under "System variables", find "Path" and click "Edit".
     4. Click "New" and add the full path to the FFmpeg `bin` folder (e.g., `C:\path\to\ffmpeg\bin`).
     5. Click "OK" to close all windows.

## What is Poetry?

Poetry is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python. It simplifies the process of managing project dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across different setups. We use Poetry to guarantee that everyone running 01 has the same environment and dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows-Specific Issues

1. **Poetry Install Error**: If you encounter an error stating "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required" when running `poetry install`, make sure you have properly installed the Microsoft C++ Build Tools as described in step 3 of the Windows installation guide.

2. **FFmpeg Not Found**: If you receive an error saying FFmpeg is not found after installation, ensure that you've correctly added the FFmpeg `bin` folder to your system PATH as described in step 5 of the Windows installation guide.

3. **Server Connection Issues**: If the server connects but you encounter errors when sending messages, double-check that all dependencies are correctly installed and that FFmpeg is properly set up in your PATH.

## Next Steps

Once you have successfully installed all the prerequisites, you're ready to clone the repository and set up the project.
