The 01 project is an open-source ecosystem for artificially intelligent devices.

By combining code-interpreting language models ("interpreters") with speech recognition and voice synthesis, the 01’s flagship operating system ("01OS") can power conversational, computer-operating AI devices similar to the Rabbit R1 or the Humane Pin.

We intend to become the “Linux” of this new space— open, modular, and free for personal or commercial use.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo, cd into the 01OS directory
git clone https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01.git
cd 01OS

# Install dependencies and run start.py
poetry install
poetry run 01
```

_Disclaimer:_ The current version of 01OS is a developer preview.
