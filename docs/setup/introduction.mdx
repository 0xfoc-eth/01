The **01** is an open-source platform for conversational devices, inspired by the *Rabbit R1* and *Star Trek* computer.

By centering this project on [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter), the 01 is more natural, flexible, and capable than its predecessors. Assistants built from this project can execute code, browse the web, read and create files, control third-party software, and beyond.

_Disclaimer:_ The current version of the 01 is an experimental developer preview.
