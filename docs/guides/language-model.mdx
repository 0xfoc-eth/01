## Hosted Models

The default LLM for 01 is GPT-4-Turbo. You can find this in the default profile in `software/source/server/profiles/default.py`.

The fast profile uses Llama3-8b served by Groq. You can find this in the fast profile in `software/source/server/profiles/fast.py`.

## Local Models

You can use local models to power 01.

Using the local profile launches the Local Explorer where you can select your inference provider and model. The default options include Llamafile, Jan, Ollama, and LM Studio.
