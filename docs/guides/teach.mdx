Sometimes the 01OS will run into a task it doesn't have the skills to do yet. When this happens, you can teach it a new skill using Teach Mode. Teach Mode consists of 3 steps: start teach mode, walk through and confirm each step, then exit teach mode.

## How To Teach

- < To start Teach Mode >
- cd ../01/01OS/ (we reccomend starting a virtual environment [would it be good to link to info on setting up a venv?])
- poetry run 01 --teach
- Enter the name of the skill you want to teach.
- Walk through the first step to show the 01OS what the action looks like.
- The 01OS will attempt to perform the first step.
- Confirm whether or not the 01OS successfully copied your action.
> - If it wasn't performed correctly, select "no" and adjust the prompt for the retrying.
> - If it was performed correctly, select "yes" and the code for that step will be added to the skill's python file 
- Once you've finished all steps required to perform the skill, confirm that the skill is complete.
- The skill has been saved as a Python file, which the 01OS can now intelligently execute whenever your prompt would benefit from the skill.

_Disclaimer:_ We caution against showing any sensitive information on your screen while Teach Mode is running.
The developer preview version of 01OS collects data during Teach Mode that is used to train the 01OS for future versions.
