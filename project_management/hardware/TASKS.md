- [ ] **Should we just buy pre-made hardware?**

Some bodies— like the 01 Light without a screen and with a camera, and the 01 Heavy as a screenless tape-recorder with a camera and a button on the side— do not exist. So perhaps we should make CAD files and build them.

Other bodies we've floated already exist as Android phones (isn't the Rabbit R1 basically an Android phone?) smartwatches, laptops, and cyberdecks.

I think we should decide by 1) estimating how long custom hardware would take, and 2) weighing it against how _memorable of an impression_ the 01 would make if it did/did't have custom hardware. Holding something unique is a big part of this. But we might accomplish that by using some of the more bizarre looking hardware.
